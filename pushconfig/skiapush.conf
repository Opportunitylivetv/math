# This configuration file controls which applications
# can be pushed to which servers.
#
# Each server is configured at [servers.{servername}]
# where {servername} is the GCE name of the server.
# The only supported value is appNames which is a list
# of applications that can be installed on the server.
#
# The names in appName should match up with the directory
# names in gs://skia-push/debs/.

# For example this section would indicated that prober and logserver can be
# deployed to server skia-testing-b.
